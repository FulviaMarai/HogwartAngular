                   After her education, Minerva worked for two years at the Ministry of Magic and later returned to Hogwarts, where she became Head of Gryffindor House and the Transfiguration professor. Though she wasn't a member of the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War, Minerva greatly helped the Ministry of Magic's resistance through spying Death Eaters and bringing the Aurors crucial information on their activities. <br> Eventually, Minerva became concurrently, at differing times, Deputy Headmistress and Headmistress of Hogwarts. In 1995, she opposed Dolores Umbridge, the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. She also protected the students from Alecto and Amycus Carrow from 1997 until 1998. As part of the Order of Phoenix's new resistance movement, Minerva fought in several battles of both wars, including the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of Hogwarts, where she led the resistance against Lord Voldemort.

                   With the conclusion of the war, Professor McGonagall was awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class, by Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt for her unwavering allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix, as well as being featured on a Chocolate Frog card, the latter of which were an accolade she admitted she had never imagined receiving. <br> Four months after the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva was officially appointed to the position of Headmistress by the Hogwarts Board of Governors, by which time the extensive damages done to the castle had been duly repaired, the protective enchantments surrounding the school restored and the faculty ready to accept a new group of First Year students.<br>
